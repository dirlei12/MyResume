        <h2>Professional Summary</h2>

        <p>Currently in my final year of Software Engineering at Unigran, I am focused on refining my technical skills,
            using modern development methods to build practical and effective solutions, and always eager to learn and
            develop new techniques and ideas. My academic journey has equipped me with foundational knowledge in
            software development, and problem-solving, and I am excited to put these skills into practice in real-world
            environments.</p>
        <p>In addition to my studies, I bring a wealth of practical experience from roles in logistics, delivery, and
            production management. As a delivery driver for ATA Logistic, I developed strong organizational and
            time-management skills while ensuring secure and timely deliveries. At Royal Mail, I honed resilience and
            attention to detail by consistently meeting performance targets in varied conditions.</p>
        <p>My most recent role as a Cell Leader at Magna Exteriors involved managing a team in a high-pressure
            production environment. I oversaw workflows, conducted final quality inspections, and implemented solutions
            to maintain productivity and meet stringent standards for automotive components. These experiences have
            sharpened my ability to lead, solve problems, and deliver results under tight deadlines.</p>
        <p>I thrive in dynamic, team-oriented environments and am motivated to contribute to organizational success by
            leveraging my unique combination of technical education and real-world experience.</p>

                10/2024 – Present <br>
                Delivery Driver <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    At ATA Logistic, I deliver a wide range of products for Amazon, including larger items and
                    high-value
                    goods,
                    directly to customers’ homes and businesses. My responsibilities include organising daily delivery
                    routes,
                    ensuring that all packages are handled with care and delivered safely, efficiently, and on time.
                    This
                    role
                    requires strong time-management skills to meet strict deadlines while adapting to changing
                    circumstances,
                    such as traffic or weather conditions. I am also responsible for maintaining a professional and
                    friendly
                    attitude when interacting with customers, ensuring a positive delivery experience. Working with
                    high-value
                    and bulky items has further strengthened my attention to detail and my ability to prioritise safety
                    and
                    security throughout the delivery process.

                As a Postman/Postwoman at Royal Mail, I was responsible for organising and preparing mail and parcels
                for

                of
                all mail items throughout the delivery process.
